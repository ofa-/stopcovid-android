        "section": "What data are shared and why",
        "description": "The data shared between two phones over their Bluetooth connections are temporary pseudo-identifiers.\nPseudo-identifiers are renewed automatically every 15 minutes. They can be a string of numbers, letters and symbols that cannot be used on their own to identify a person.\n\nThe application shares these data with the server managed by the Ministry for Solidarity and Health, only if you have been diagnosed as a COVID-19 case and only if you give your consent. If you do, then other users’ apps can connect to the server to find out if they have been close to your phone. If they have, the users will receive an alert that they have been exposed to a contamination risk and they will be encouraged to contact their doctors.\n\nThe users receiving the alert will have no information about the phone that triggered the alert or about the owner of the phone.\n\n The app does not take account of special circumstances, such as situations where specific protection measures are in place, including the use of personal protection equipment by healthcare personnel, or separation by a pane of glass. Users can deactivate the app temporarily at any time."
