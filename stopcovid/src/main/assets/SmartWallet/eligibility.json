		"desc":"WE CAN HAVE PIVOT DATES AS WELL HERE FOR ELP. There are three types of rules,including vaccine,recovery,and positive tests. #AR,#AZ and #JA are aliases to the list of products. But we can also have a list of products directly or a mix of aliases and product codes (ex #AR and EU/1/20/1528). For a rule,if no 'doses' field,then it applies to all completed vaccines (with completed = currentDose >= targetDoses i.e. 3/3, 2/1, 3/1 etc.). In case of absence of 'elg' field, it means there is no eligibility if this rule matches."
