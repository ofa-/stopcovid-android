        "section": "How to interpret",
        "description": "Since December 8 2020, all test results, RT-PCR or TAg (antigen test), enter into the production of SI-DEP indicators (incidence rate, positivity rate and screening rate).\n\nThe epidemiological approach of Santé publique France favors indicators (incidence rate, positivity, screening) focused on people. The current calculation methods applied by Santé publique France are as follows:\n\n- number of people tested: calculated over a given period (7 days for example), it corresponds to the number of people having had at least one test during this period and who have never tested positive in the previous 60 days;\n\n- number of people who tested positive: a person who tests positive either for the first time or more than 60 days after a previous positive test will be counted as a new case.\n\nIn general, the indicators should be interpreted with caution and in their entirety.\n\nFor more information on the analysis of the health situation, please consult the weekly epidemiological point of Santé publique France (SpF) available on santepubliquefrance.fr",

        "section": "Changes in methodology",
        "description": "The matches are necessary to identify the proportion of hospitalized patients who are vaccinated and / or carry a particular variant or mutation.\n\nSince October 29, 2021, methodological changes have been made:\n\n- The indicators relate to the population aged 20 and over, due to the low number of hospitalizations among people aged under 20 and the later opening of vaccination for the young population.\n\n- The indicators make it possible to take into account the notion of eligibility for vaccination. From now on, if a patient hospitalized or tested positive is also present in VAC-SI, he will be considered vaccinated, if he is considered \"eligible\" for vaccination, he will be considered unvaccinated. If no information is available, the age, department and sex variables will be taken into account to estimate its vaccination status.\n\nThe effects of these methodological changes are an upward revision of the number of events (tests positive or hospitalizations) in vaccinated persons, and a downward revision in unvaccinated persons."
